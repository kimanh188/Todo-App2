# React + Vite - Todo List

This project is an upgraded version of my very first React project Todo-App â€“ a CRUD application. Users can not only add, check off, edit, and delete todos but also log in using their Google accounts. This experience significantly bolstered my understanding of React and familiarized me with Firebase.

## Key Features

- **Google Account Integration:** Users can seamlessly log in using their Google accounts, adding an extra layer of convenience to the todo management experience.

- **CRUD Operations:** The app supports standard CRUD operations, allowing users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete todos effortlessly. Todos are securely stored for future use.

## Development Stack

This project utilizes the React framework and Vite, a modern build tool that offers a blazing-fast development experience.

## Project Inspiration

After I presented my initial Todo-App version (ToDo-App1), our teacher decided to embark on a similar project, sharing insights and guiding the development of a more advanced version. This experience provided me with a better grasp of using SVGs and introduced me to Firebase authentication, skills that I applied to enhance this project. While it is rooted in a course project, this work also reflects my own learnings and insights.
